# Read & Rank Prototype

A React-based prototype for the Read & Rank feature, which allows users to evaluate candidate responses anonymously and rank them based on alignment with their views.

## Overview

This prototype implements a four-phase user experience:

1. **Quote Evaluation** - Users swipe through candidate responses (agree/disagree)
2. **Collection View** - Review all agreed-upon quotes
3. **Ranking Interface** - Drag and drop to rank quotes by priority
4. **Results Reveal** - View candidate matches with alignment percentages

## Features

### ✨ Core Functionality
- **Anonymous Evaluation**: Candidate responses shown without names, parties, or photos
- **Swipe Gestures**: Intuitive swipe left (disagree) / swipe right (agree) interface
- **Drag & Drop Ranking**: Tactile ranking interface with visual feedback
- **Candidate Matching**: Algorithm calculates alignment percentages
- **Results Visualization**: Beautiful results table with gradient backgrounds
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop

### 🎨 Design System
- **EV Color Palette**: Implements the exact Empowered Vote color scheme
- **Manrope Typography**: Clean, modern font throughout
- **Smooth Animations**: Framer Motion powered transitions and micro-interactions
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant with keyboard navigation

### 📱 User Experience
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript (basic functionality)
- **Touch Optimized**: Large touch targets and haptic feedback simulation
- **Keyboard Accessible**: Full navigation without mouse
- **Reduced Motion Support**: Respects user motion preferences

## Technology Stack

## Key Components

### QuoteCard
Swipeable card component with gesture detection:
- Drag threshold: 120px
- Rotation: ±15 degrees
- Visual feedback during drag
- Accessibility: Screen reader friendly

### RankingPhase
Drag & drop interface using @dnd-kit:
- Sortable quote cards
- Visual drop zones
- Keyboard navigation support
- Touch optimized for mobile

### ResultsPhase
Results visualization with:
- Animated alignment gauges
- Gradient backgrounds by rank
- Staggered entrance animations
- Responsive table layout

## State Management

Uses Zustand for lightweight state management:

```typescript
interface ReadRankState {
  phase: 'evaluation' | 'collection' | 'ranking' | 'results';
  quotesToEvaluate: Quote[];
  agreedQuotes: Quote[];
  rankedQuotes: RankedQuote[];
  candidateMatches: MatchingResult[];
}
```

## Matching Algorithm

The alignment algorithm:
1. Assigns points to user rankings (1st=5pts, 2nd=4pts, etc.)
2. Calculates candidate alignment percentage
3. Sorts candidates by alignment score
4. Provides detailed breakdown per issue

## Design System

### Colors
- **Primary Text**: `#1c1c1c` (Black)
- **Background**: `#ffffff` (White) 
- **Primary Action**: `#ff5740` (Coral)
- **Quote Cards**: `#00657c` (Muted Blue)
- **Results Gradient**: Coral to Yellow gradients
- **Accent**: `#59b0c4` (Light Blue)

### Typography
- **Font Family**: Manrope (all weights)
- **Headings**: Bold, 28-32px
- **Body Text**: Medium, 16-18px
- **Instructions**: SemiBold, 18-22px
- **Buttons**: Bold, 16px

### Spacing
- **Mobile-first** approach
- **Max-width**: 1200px centered
- **Card padding**: 24px internal
- **Vertical spacing**: 32px between sections
- **Button padding**: 14px vertical, 32px horizontal

## Accessibility Features

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance
- **Color Contrast**: Minimum 4.5:1 ratio
- **Touch Targets**: 44x44px minimum
- **Focus Indicators**: 3px coral outline
- **Screen Readers**: Semantic HTML + ARIA labels

### Keyboard Navigation
- **Tab Order**: Logical flow through interface
- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate within ranking interface
- **Enter/Space**: Activate buttons and drag operations
- **Escape**: Cancel operations and close modals

### Motion Preferences
- **Reduced Motion**: Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
- **Alternative Animations**: Fade transitions for sensitive users
- **Performance**: GPU-accelerated transforms only

## Performance Optimizations

### Bundle Size
- **Target**: <250KB gzipped initial load
- **Code Splitting**: Route-based splitting by phase
- **Tree Shaking**: Removes unused Framer Motion features

### Animation Performance

## Render settings live in ev-infra

This repo's Render services (`read-rank-frontend`) are managed by the Render Blueprint in
[`EmpoweredVote/ev-infra`](https://github.com/EmpoweredVote/ev-infra) (`render.yaml`).

- Build and start commands, rewrites, headers, custom domains, plans, cron
  schedules and build filters change **only through a PR to ev-infra**. Render
  syncs its `main` branch automatically.
- A setting changed in the Render dashboard is **undone on the next sync**.
- Env var **values** are the exception: set them in the Render dashboard. Add a
  new variable's name to ev-infra (with `sync: false`) so the record stays complete.
- Do not add a `render.yaml` to this repo. Render does not read it.
